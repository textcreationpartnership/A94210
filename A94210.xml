         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ignorant, it is ſufficient they have the learned (though malefactours) for
their preſidents; private relations ſo charme them, that they ſeem to be

ſuppreſt ſuperſtition, or the graduals of Idolatry? It is a facile
matter, to make lubricke profeſſions, and reſerved oathes; but how doe
they checke ſuch ſemblances by the expreſſe oppoſition of the

It is more eaſie to reſiſt than rule; and not to admit, then being
admitted to moderate a miſchiefe; where the ſupreame priviledges
(politicall or divine) are in hazard, the greateſt ayd may be made uſe of
for their preſervation; and if the King deny to ſecure his people by His
power, they may ſecure themſelves by their own; For as farre as publique
are preferrable before private advantages, ſo farre an Ordinance in
Parliament before the meere perſonall commands of a Prince. A King is as a
private perſon, if not conſidered in the execution of his Kingly Office,
and in that Office he hath His limits. It is a paradox to reaſon, that the
will of one ſhould ſubvert the being of a Nation; for poſterity may have

rightly, but if I wrong the Commonwealth uſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. The caſe
might be concluded with Doctor <hi>Ferne,</hi> if the King did ſolely
deviate, the beſt way were to withhold from him what he willeth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to
accompliſh his unjuſt ends, and ſo the flame might be extinguiſhed by
withdrawing the fuell; but this caſe is of a different complexion, His
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties actions have an influence upon many, or rather, theirs upon him;
and for former want of Parliaments, there is ſuch a ſwarme of evill doers
in the Land, that they ſtand in need of a protection; and becauſe they
cannot ſafeguard themſelves, they will have aſſiſtants of equall
guilt, and for that a reſiſtance (ſo pernicious) cannot be ſupported
without ſome power that may ſtrike terrour in the people, they have got the
King to owne them, and that no ſooner attain'd, but (by ſome
ſuperuſuall prevalency, which we have cauſe to feare Heavens have
permitted for our ſcourge) have ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our Soveraigne to leave His
Parliament, (a fatall blow, and the ſeed of our ſufferings,) and now they
can boaſt of their cauſe, their Captaine, and their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; and woe unto
us, in that our Kings perſonall and politicall powers are intercombatants. It
is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne how their Army conſiſts of many who would not ſtay to
heare the meaning of juſtice; that pretend to fight for, what apparently they
fly from, who fame truth, and therefore feare the touchſtone; ſome there
may be (whoſe worth the weale publique hath never heard of) and for ought
that can be judged of them are meere indifferents for Law, and Laodiceans for 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155687:6"/>religion, and of ſuch I conclude that theſe troubles
might ſooner be determined, were they as good as they are great. Thoſe who
are related to His Majeſty, as Servants, Officers, Favorites, (or that expect
any ſuch intereſts in reverſion, or otherwiſe) are many, and we wonder
not if they are borne away in the ſtreame of their expectations: What
Biſhops doe proceed (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly) from a ſpirit of revenge (which is ever
acted with envy) and ceaſeth not till the object of its malice be made the
ſubject of their chaſtiſement: we expect not reaſons from ignorants,
nor why indigents thruſt themſelves upon ſuch a ſervice; it is more
then ſufficient, that defect of wit and wealth are their prime inducements.
Papiſts (whoſe Religion tolerates them to be cruell) begin to make us
ſenſible of a papall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; they acknowledge Proteſtancy, and their
uſurped Catholiſme, to be direct contraries, and yet they are undertakers
for defence of the Proteſtant religion, (a myſtery to reaſon, and a
perillous inſinuation) indeed they are <hi>(ad haras aptiores quam ad
aras)</hi> fitter to be marked for mortall enemies, then competent
aſſiſtants, and beyond contradiction they will make uſe of their power
to root out their oppoſers; of all which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons take a ſurvey, and you
will finde the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their ſtrength very inconſiderable; ſo that
the inſtruments the matter, and manner of their firſt diſſeverance from
us, and aſſociation amongſt themſelves and the ends they apparently
propound may ſo ſtigmatize their pretences that none who prize their owne
or poſterities good can forbeare to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their ſuppreſſion. To
what diſtreſſes we are now ſubjected, a tender heart cannot conceive,
without great reluctancy; and we are the more unhappy in <pb n="8" facs="tcp:155687:7"/>this, that we begin to be weary of defending our lives, liberties, and
religion; great Forces are raiſed, a great worke is on foot, the hearts of
people are enlarged, and why ſhould their hands be ſtraitened? There is a
publique Felicity, which claimes the Publique Faith, Juſtice is the efficient
cauſe of Law, execution the life of power; the protection of offenders
juſtifies the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and to diſpence with puniſhment is an implicite
incouragement: to intruſt the Kingdome in unſafe hands is to provide for
its ruine; and ſhould the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion periſh, the Parliament ſitting, what
blemiſh would accrue to ſuch future aſſemblies? many are acquainted
with their diſeaſe and remedy, and ſleighting both, blame the
Phiſitians; what monſters are they to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what mockers of God, whiles
they thus perſiſt? many never appeared, and ſome appearing have
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated multitudes by their apoſtacies, ſo ſweet is the name of
propriety, and the Mammon of this world, that they dote upon the increaſe of
wealth, whiles a loſſe of the totall ſhould more affect them; they are
ſo far from believing, that it is requiſite to hazard all for the
preſervation of all, that they will not hazzard part for the ſecuring of
the reſt; they imagine not how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall and dependant all intereſts be,
nor how they are bound by the Lawes of God, nature, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſacrifice
themſelves, much more their eſtates, for the generall good (wherein they
have a particular ſhare.) There is a ſtrange miſpriſion of the word
Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, when it is taken for the eſſentiall independency of the
Kingdome; for it doth, or ought to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from every member, and
ſo by participation they are both compleated. Thoſe that fall backe from
their good beginnings checke their owne judgements, <pb n="9" facs="tcp:155687:7"/>and
diſcover their diffidence; in the one, they become objects of ſcorne to the
world; in the other, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Almighty to puniſh them with what they
feare. The vulgar preſuppoſe ſome inviſible power in a Kingdome to
preſerve it ſelfe, and twere more tolerable if it were in them an act of
faith; but being otherwiſe, how doe they injure themſelves, the weale
publique, and ſucceeding ages, by their ſhuffelings; (and it were well if
the practiſe of greater perſons did not ſavour of theſe or more
ridiculous tenets.) The worke is framed, the inſtruments appointed, and the
wheele of reformation is now rouling about, and will you deny Oyle to refreſh
the decayed ſinews thereof? And although it be the opinion of every
Chriſtian, <hi>(quod non pecuniam ſed militum ducumque virtutem belli &amp;
imperii nervum eſſe)</hi> that it is not money, but the good cauſe and
vertuous Captaines, that are the chiefe cauſes of victory, yet in concurrent
and ſecond cauſes we may urge the ſaying of <hi>Demoſthenes, Opus
ſunt opes &amp; ſine iis nihil fiet quod opus,</hi> There is need of
riches, and without them nought can be done that is needfull. <hi>Thucyd.</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Bellum non eſt in armis, ſed in expenſis &amp; ſumptibus
per quos efficacia arma &amp; utilia ſiunt,</hi> warre conſiſts more in
expence then Armes. And as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſaid to the father of <hi>Alexander,
Haſtis pugna argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis atque omnia vinces,</hi> Fight with gilded Spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> and be confident of the conqueſt. Much uſe may be
made of ſuch morall ſentences. Gods uſuall way of working is by meanes,
and where ſuch a way is offered it is a great ſinne in man to neglect it; a
ſupernaturall potency is not limited to naturall, but naturall to it; we
tempt our maker, in loſing our opportunities; in all contrivances there are
the principles and inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals <pb n="10" facs="tcp:155687:8"/>&amp; it is a groſſe
omiſſion not to improve things for their proper ends, <hi>Evangelum non
tollit politias &amp; fides non deſtruit naturam,</hi> The Goſpell takes
not away po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, nor doth faith deſtroy nature; ſpirituall things doe not
exclude temporall, but regulate them; Our truſt in our divine Captaine
forbids not the uſe of helpes, but declares them ſubordinate. Oh let not
the practice of men publiſh them guilty of ſuch unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable opinions;
nor let them conceale themſelves, leſt judgement finde them out; he that
gives the Talent will demand an account; and ſhall thy brethren pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
whiles thou haſt meanes to prevent it? It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and ingratefull
part to accompany deſigners to a hazard, and there to leave them; to
aſſiſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations of a good worke, and to relinquiſh the ſame
unfiniſhed, manifeſts an ill qualified mind; (for ſuch variation is
inconſiſtent with the life of a Chriſtian.) Doe you diſpute the
ſecurity of moneys lent out? you may rather doubt of the ſafety of what you
retaine; what greater ingagement can be expected, (or being expected, can be
given) then the body repreſentative of a Kingdome? they are intruſted in
the whole, and ſhall they be diſtruſted in regard of part? can any
knowing man conjecture, that they have not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, intereſts, and
expectations equall to any other? ſhall your election give them (and your
diffidence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them of) your confidences? they are agitating your
affairs, &amp; will you not allow their disburſements. For your
ſatisfaction, they have exceeded the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of any of their
predeceſſors, and are become your particular accountants, and doe you
ſtill repine? we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read of any denials of ſupply (when demanded by
former Parliaments, but how the people have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boweld <pb n="11" facs="tcp:155687:8"/>themſelves in ſuch a caſe is obvious, to every Hiſtorian;) will
you be the firſt that ever deſerted (take heed you bewaile not being
deſtitute of) ſuch a Councell? Is it probable they will ſo dilacerate the
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritys of future Parliaments, as not to diſ-ingage themſelves? Not to
give credence to a private friend, is inhumanity; not to a Parliament is morall
infidelity. When that ſerene day ſhall appeare wherein theſe troubles
ſhall admit of a tranquillity, you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident to receive your owne
with advantage, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim they are ſharers with you in your
ſufferings. <hi>He that gives to the poore, lends to the Lord;</hi>
neceſſity deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates poverty, and what ſo great as that which is
publique? if times thus continue, the rich will be made a prey, and will
rejoyce to preſerve any part of their eſtates; To be involved in a
condition equall to the moſt miſerable, is a thing we feare not, but are
like to taſte of. When His Majeſties forces were at <hi>Branford,</hi> many
of the malignants ſent neceſſaries to the Army againſt him, what they
did (againſt their ſeeming ſelves) becauſe of feare, ſhall not we doe
much more for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake? ſo ſtupid are the hearts of men, that
no arguments have any inforcement, unleſſe tipt with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant danger, and
thoſe onely referring to their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall loſſes; perils meerely
imminent (to what ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they relate) leave a ſleight impreſſion,
but I pray ſuch may eſcape a too late repentance. What I here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
refers onely to thoſe who ſee a neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and who
either have not afforded ſome ſupplies, or if they have, intend no
addition; Alas, our miſeries grow, the enemies forces are like Caterpillers
in the land; we have <hi>Moſes</hi> prayers, but want <hi>Aarons</hi> rod;
nature cals upon you, to be tender of thouſands who <pb n="12" facs="tcp:155687:9"/>carry
their lives in their hands for your ſake; religion dictates this way, to
prevent the powers of the prelates, &amp;c. who have long tyrannized over the
truth; your own ſafety may inform you what ſadneſſe will ſeize upon
you when you muſt ſurvive your liberties The Queſtion is not whether
religion or no religion, lawes or no lawes, but whether both in their purity
and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor ſhall take place? As for thoſe who delight in theſe
diſtractions, who gaine by the peoples groanings, or who are ſuch perſons
formerly intimated, or their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, I invoke the omnipotent for their
conviction, and that in the meane time their hands may not bring to paſſe
their owne enterprizes. And here ſorrow ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedes expreſſions,
<hi>Labeo. omnis morbus eſt habitus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra naturam,</hi> (every diſeaſe
being a habite againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;) the diſeaſe and cure of this Region do
much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject me, warre is the phyſick, and muſt we not expect a doubtfull
combat betwixt the ſpirits and the humors? The animadverſion of His
Majeſties paſt, and preſent condition, doth diſſolve my thoughts into
teares, even in this that the Defender of the Faith ſhould <hi>(per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
aut aliter)</hi> become an offence to the faithfull. But we hope the principles
of Law and Religion have ſtill reſidence in His Royall breſt, &amp; will
appeare, when the obſtructions occaſioned by evill Counſellors ſhall be
made perſpicuous, and that in the cloſe of differences the hearts of the
people ſhall have cauſe to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acclamations for their Soveraignes
ſafety, their Parliaments fidellity their owne liberty, their religions
ſettlement, and poſterities approaching happineſſe; which ſweet
ſaeſon heavens haſten to this Kingdomes comfort.</p>
